# Python-2D-Maze-Game


Things to rework: collision detection gets buggy while initializing alot of Enemies.
- Probably put everything in while loop and make everything move by pixel to avoid collision bugs.

Things to add: - Point System
               - Collision with the enemies
               - Add coins to pick up
